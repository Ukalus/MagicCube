# MagicCube

A Virtual RubixCube made with Three.js. This was made to learn about Three.js and Computergraphics in general.
It was also suprisingly challenging to create the cube data structure itself in a way so that you could turn it. 

### Planned features

- [x] Render Magicube.
- [x] Be Able to turn forwards on all Axes.
- [ ] Be Able to turn Backwards.
- [ ] Config file to set Cube- & Background-Colors;
- [ ] Sensible Control-Scheme.
- [ ] Use Textures instead of Basecolors.

### Controls

The Controls are a little crude right now,
but you can turn each row on every Axes just like on a real RubixCube.
